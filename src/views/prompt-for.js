/**
 * What to paste into a fresh chat.
 *
 * Four versions of this have been wrong, each in a smaller way than the last.
 * The one before this said the right things in the wrong voice: it opened with
 * "Using teamctx", numbered its checks ahead of the question, and named the
 * statement's ancestors "the What" and "the Why". What came back was written in
 * those words — headings, field names, a walk back up the tree — to somebody who
 * had asked about one line on a page and does not care how it is stored.
 *
 * So the question comes first, in the words the person would use out loud, and
 * everything the assistant has to do is below it under a heading addressed to
 * the assistant. The checks are unchanged; they are just no longer the first
 * thing anybody reads.
 *
 * It says what to talk about and nothing about how to lay it out. An earlier
 * draft banned headings and bullet lists, which is the wrong lever: the problem
 * was never the shape of the answer but its subject — an assistant explaining
 * the data model instead of the work — and telling a model how to format itself
 * costs it the formatting it would have chosen well.
